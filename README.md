# Shopify_B2B
Shopify provides a business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce solution that allows seamless wholesale selling alongside other business operations.  
This project aims to integrate the Shopify B2B data with the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, NetSuite, and enable BI (Business Intelligence) reporting.
To achieve this aim, the scope includes 
1. Create the cloud databases to store the Shopify B2B data
2. Design the ETL data pipelines to transfer data from Shopify B2B to the database, then from the database to NetSuite, and then from NetSuite back to Shopify B2B
